## Notes 

This project was developed in angular and java, the main idea is to write down notes so as to have the memory of all the appointments. I wanted to insert the about note but then I thought it was highly useless, Also this project was made to learn java springboot and angular. As database I chose h2 an in-memory database which is very fast to do some kind of operations.


## Java 
  
In Java I decided to extend the JPA REPOSITORY which simplifies my life and loombok to create constructors or getters and setters, I also used logs in some classes thanks to the slf4j library


## Angular 
In angular I made requests to the server thanks to the http method and thanks to ruoute I made the change from one page to another thanks to the navigate and I made the notes movable thanks to angular matirial
